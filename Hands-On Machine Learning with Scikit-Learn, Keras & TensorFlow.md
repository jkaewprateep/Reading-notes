Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow

[ L1, L2 distributions and elastic net ]: 🧸💬 Apply Scikit-learn of LLM model with Ridge regression, Losso, and elastic net. The application is suitable for considering whether or not to accelerate slope function ( m ) and combine it with distance condition ( r ). </br>

🐑💬 ➰ We called L1 & L2 penalty but it is not when applying gradient descent to accumulate results for our solution our loss function ofter negative value for better result ( 💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 We had learned about vertical reverse graph for prediction model ) </br>

🐐💬 There is no limit for L1 & L2, but they can have multiple layers such as the application of traffic communication because it has more complex and speaker conversations. In this example we consider local and global loss function scope calculation please see the attachment picture you can see the upper picture to find the solution faster but it uses time to optimize for the best result. Elastic combines both advantages for fast optimization and best results. </br>

🤠💬 In some development communication orbits may require L3 because they are communicating with priority. Complex relationship implications by Losso regression or Elastic net. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, implications contain scopes and objectives when development with center or none center.  Different observers may have their internal projects included and they can select to communicate or provide the prediction results. </br>

🦤💬 There is not always success in every project every time we work on an experiment but information can be shared and the prediction result is true. Start of the project your results always perform good result now or later. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Once upon a time we believe all experiment conclusions everything but communication and work collaboration it is. How does the powerful elastic net perform on different ( r ) ⁉️ </br>

🦁💬 Engineer will win in this round because we had a strapper that is cautious before you tears ‼️ </br>
