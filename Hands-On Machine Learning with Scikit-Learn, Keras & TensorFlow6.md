[ PCA linear auto-encoders ]: 🧸💬 PCA technique is the same technique when we find a solution and a significant variable for a solution. The PCA linear auto-encoder is a symmetric way to express function and correlation for specific dimensions. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ This is a famous method working in 2D and more dimension for coordinate system position present because they can present and respond to new activities from one or many nodes frequently without updating all references. </br>

🐐💬 Possible that all orbits are collapsed ⁉️ </br>

🤠💬 PCA technique you can assign orbit variables for local and global update values for correlation coordinates in the scopes of our consideration. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, all information in remote devices is sensed by remote sensors that have information, automatic responses, and delayed response but we are talking about kilometers distance. </br>

🦤💬 The PCA technique is used in many solutions and sciences, where data analysis can identify data correlation and interest that can improve performance. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 In communication PCA is also used for source identification and item separation that can be performed automatically and benefits same as in Speech recognition when you do not have single-source access but use the environment sources. </br>

🦁💬 In communication equipment we also found PCA for source identification and DSP for signal conversion availability because they are used in fields of high-variance radios. </br>
