[ Tensorboard ]: 🧸💬 Statistics logging, training values, and dataset or information can be stored or aggregated data into Tensorboard. This information supports data visualization and evaluation methods with the model's performance, activation, and custom functions. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ There are several solutions to the problem when you can perform Gradient Tape for long dataset aggregation function or aggregate data and visualization with data visualization tools to perform optimization of your solution. An example of machine learning in pattern recognition data is when AI cannot recognize all patterns simultaneously.</br>

🐐💬 Tensorboard support of aggregate batch for synchronizing data from target folder with tools for visualization, and development of real-time data integration. Same as database tasks aggregate data and restore data perform by command and you can specific ranges of data in the effects. </br>

🤠💬 It is the correct method to retrieve data using the export function and can create simultaneous tasks and an action on this command every time. Before confirming your result make sure you had simultaneous, both data and your teammates. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, We accepted simultaneous tasks, and maybe in communication sim data is aggregated data not the entire TB of your HDD. We can restore and use them but our scope is to help with the TensorFlow program. </br>

🦤💬 Make sure you have a save method and save command parameters submitted in the message communication and for a third-party library you need to convert into Tensorflow format for model.load() </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 There are multiple ways to simultaneous your results by the Tensorboard and gradients values from the experiment. Submitting gradient values and significant training and testing functions can be saved to Tensor files, CheckPoint, Text files, databases, and hash tables. </br>

🦁💬 There are tools for tensor, tensor-lite, the saved results conversation, and model conversion when we can implement our small neuron networks into small IoT devices. Please implement your network support layers or you may find some questions he replied. </br>

Sample: How to convert a Sampling Down Dense layer into ioT devices for image conversion. </br>
