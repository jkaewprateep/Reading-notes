[ Discriminators GAN networks ]: 🧸💬 The discriminator's GAN network is a generative neuron network that categorizes items in detail definition or use in the validation process. The generative model performs on multiple items and can compare items in multiple input augmentation views. ( Find real from fakes or find identical in the target inputs ) </br>

🐑💬 ➰ By using the discriminator GAN network we can apply the optimizer function on deviation functions instead of its values because we are categorized into multiple learning scales. </br>

🐐💬 The implementation codes may look difficult and complex than normal code implementation, see the codes in the reference and selection apply function but do not forget that the Gradient Tape definition allows a logical program to apply to values as historical records and perform immediate evaluation and final evaluation for each step, epoch, batch or interval by the setup program condition. </br>

🤠💬 Consider multiple datasets assigned for an assignment they are security as divided data information with control sources and a closet path to the original source. Encryption, online invokable method, definition, native library, re-scaling, and significant datasets are standard methods working with distribution security standards. </br>

🧸💬 I have only the start values with gradients values then I cannot build the system without original information and correct understanding. Discriminator GAN networks can perform over networks or even offline taken assignments at home For this reason we know many application shared processes as in commercial and public donation process RAM applications. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, In the distribution process and verification result they had intervals for validation and recalculation also verifying the submitted distribution works. Not only kernel algorithms but seamlessly working processes on any remote devices promote the idea of working equilibrium. </br>

🦤💬 First understand the process and work algorithms by studying the experiment input and the objectives, and categorize image models only categorize types of image objects. As in CIFAR-100 example datasets you may find a computer girl 🤠 but input dataset examples are different. We need to find significant values before performing the task and found that CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are different in the difficulty level at the beginning this way we can evaluate the model by dataset significance. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Discriminators GAN networks work on larger scales but may use the same input because we know elephants 🐘 are different than deer 🦌 but star deer and forest deer are different because they develop their significance by environment as communications.
🐯💬 Culture-INFO, tiger skin tattoos are fingerprint significant too 🦓🐎🐠 ... </br>

🦁💬 I am thinking about something like footprints 👣🔍🤔 the fingerprints are not determined of the victims or harasser but scopes of examination because their intention to travel to activities in the same place are significant. </br>
