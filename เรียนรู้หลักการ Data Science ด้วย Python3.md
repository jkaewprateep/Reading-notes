[ Expression and Lexical density ]: 🧸💬 For text conversation and data mining one task is to find the original or source or the information input from the printed text or in document format, surveys, and composite data information. Lexical density can be determined using multiple methods. Still, the simplest is the most repeating word from the sentence conversation, categorize, name and date format, and regional format displayed in the document. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ I found one news broadcaster who repeated words she likes to express more than everyone because she had worked as the data input and text content generator such as 'of', 'again', 'reveal', 'perhave', 'similar' and 'dignity'. </br>

🐐💬 Perhave we should scopes of the browser search engines and the application accessibility because of that also dangerous for individual writers even examples with codings and experiments results. </br>

🧸💬 Expression is for helping the understanding of people and readers when experiment results in you need a reference to referred and sources can be validated online with original work, by implementation codes and objectives that is make reviews assignment as research and study discussions. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, we do not use more luxurious words to express a simple thing and we do not use repeating words to create the same meaning for the word we are expressing when some word we can create and understand by the content and followers later find in television and movie often 'dignity', 'harass', 'creeps', 'storms-hammer', 'blows-kick' and 'Paladin mazes'. </br>

🦤💬 Weapons create better effects from the advantage of nonblocking or expecting, in many games and science, weapons of unexpecting when they can accelerate from the same velocity by angular velocity that is new and unexpected when they were met. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Lexical density does not mean categorized students and nationality but improvement of the ability to use English or programming languages they can be best with their culture. We are not expected to see the words 'gains', 'generate', 'symmetric', 'realistic', and 'damp bandwidths' from none electrical engineering students but any student can learn and understand the word that creates engineer behave word conversation and it has positive effects when talking with electrical engineers. </br>

🦁💬 I am starting to get used to word conversation of dress codes, bulletproof, extra stamina, understructure construct, proximal, long duration by capacity, and smallest but make more contrast from my student class. </br>
