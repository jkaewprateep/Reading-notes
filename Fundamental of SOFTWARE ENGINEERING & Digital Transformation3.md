[ Message services specifications ]: 🧸💬 Business profile for communications, extract, load data items, database schemas, data fields property, and exchangeable or convertible fields. </br>

🐐💬 Some Dynamics programs provide convertible fields for backdate verification or consumable by different versions of data communication client configuration but it will have warnings in the message and the platform programmer needs answers to the warning message content information and error handling methods. </br>

🐑💬 ➰In case of convertible fields or different schemas versions possible when you working with integration systems from different versions and they have the same namespace and address, rename the namespace or the address. This is the sample of working with a converted DEV environment to UAT spending time for workable backtracking logs and application data flow logics. </br>

🐯💬 Culture INFO of the message negotiation compares at major version and one precision minor version and when there is some miss matching of the target versions older versions with none convertible fields will be used because they are not a major concern in minor changed. </br>

🦁💬 In  this case some data fields are not working at the same logics and tada 🦭💬 What sup bros ⁉️ </br>

🦁💬 The fast investigation start when in working project there are multiple of changed and one of it is upgrade of the system APIs that is why people think that is because of new API versions that should have more effects. </br>

👧💬 🎈 Message communication reliability when it is matching < 99% of expecting message communication fields, application is readable and extract of the values but will request for complete information that is additional message communication and when the update every node expects the same schema format. </br>

🦭💬 That is because the existing services is not shot down and in transform process for new communication services, they are maintain for testing and development. </br>
