[ Attention network and transformers ]: 🧸💬 Talking about auto-encodings, autoencoders are good at learning sequences with small different data sequences for better results when transformers work with multiple data types. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ Learning and recognition process you can perform multiple times on the same or different networks same as famous neuron networks because even more time process the prediction result becomes closer and with these methods they support teaching and student's learning process for learning from trained model. </br>

🐐💬 It is simply you can work with an encoder's text message distributed on the Internet or in movies but creating auto-encoder networks for the process uses some skills and experience. They both perform well with continuous normalized data. </br>

🤠💬 Concatenated networks are the initial of this idea when all networks learn from the same lesson but they provide different results and concatenated results create more efficient overall. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, students networks are not too much of contrast networks interest or they create multiple challenges and draws more attention than other networks. </br>

🦤💬 Encoders are significant because of their learning weights and signatures adding more signatures into input for the process is possible and it can act as prevention duplication or create suitable inputs for the processing network. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Start training from significant signatures is the same as water colours method update is working on the training samples when some primary series remain. </br>

🦁💬 Encoding signatures they are talking about in the television but more mathematics order degrees than watercolours in the picture signatures even though we do not have the originally trained equation reflection of random values reflecting some property, degrees of communication values. </br>
