[ Bayesian probability ]: 🧸💬 In machine learning to define data models with scopes of probabilities of events distributions, property of method from random distribution resultsets and possibly contain within logits shape and finite solution from known probability method formulas. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ Finite solution, transform, or simplex will required for accuracy and performance solution and result. The co-existence is one example of the learning exception method. </br>

🐐💬 In movies or contrast conversations they are trying to create absolute objective that is because machine learning can focus on the learning experience but absolute objective will create another way. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ For example in the Physical momentum velocity relationship they defined chemical energy transfer will create a new solution for this study. This is called the unlearning technique. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO even if you have trained the model with high accuracy you need to perform tests with the dataset provided and your dataset for evaluation because of not only the dataset and data fields but also they had some significant learning inputs such as data source reliability, communication dataset ( they are prepared and aggregated for commercials ) and data integration problems. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Have you finished your homework today⁉️ </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Have you finished your homework today⁉️ </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Students always say no or say nothing but some studies try to crack my logic by saying I love you ‼️ </br>
