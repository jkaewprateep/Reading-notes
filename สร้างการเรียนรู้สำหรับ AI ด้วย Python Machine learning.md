[ Correlation evaluation method ]: 🧸💬 There are many data evaluation methods to find relationships, patterns, significance, property, duplication, indicates, and repeatability of the data present from the samples. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ In the book's example accuracy, correlation, precision, recall, f1 scores, and error rates are sub-methods and ready to call from the dataset and its function. But they had some significant usages with the same dataset of data and some libraries you need to indicate or remove NaN values or replace with your suitable method for your experiment. </br>

🦭💬 The correlation is a fast calculation method to find the correlation pattern between variables, significant, and related methods for the experiment when some functions are external functions and not designed to create a response to any experiment method. How do you find the feedback response function to perform correlate values calculation for better feedback performance ⁉️ </br>

🐐💬 Many tasks had natural function responses that are because of random distribution values or natural patterns of their function such as word sentences, human setup passwords, non-encrypted data communication messages, and related time-scales input functions such as time input significant function, clock-counter, time-cyclings function and human conversations. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO to not include time as a significant output-related function because in the same environment, they can line up the message communication and find some useful pattern, encryption, and none-related time stamp input function method to perform. </br>
