[ Logits to perform simple logic tasks ]: 🧸💬 In programming we know that compiled code from readable text into the computer understanding symbols characters is for execution on target CPU or machine. Neuron networks and logits can transform into digital numbers or float present of logits learning tasks or operation of the artificial intelligence networks the same. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ This process has the advantage of preventing reverse engineering and technology in production when a small number of changes can create different operation results or hard-to-perform removed program logic embedded. </br>

🐐💬 The ideal number of precision values is not significant as they can build a re-scalings machine for demonstration with control logic embedded values we called them re-scalings but they cannot revert engineering to full performance machine programming as the option for demonstration stage. </br>

🧸💬 There is more than one number pattern to perform the same task or there are multiple tasks that can be performed on the same number pattern but it is not recommended that is adaptive ability. Understanding of generative AI and their concept to understand one network training for multiple purposes not only for chat or content creation. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, the unknown objective neuron network should not be repeated except to find their objective and their effectiveness when this study in security is the same as IT security sandbox scenarios. </br>

🦤💬 Reliability cannot be determined without the objective of the program and process to management, one way to build the application is when the process is statics and the machine learning can perform the tasks parallel with the process for evaluation of their performance along with development and controls. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Similar applications of the embedded logic can create an intellectual property right concern when software is embedded and they are working online and offline without the need to inform of the message as regulation. Some companies can copy the image processing machine learning and cannot perform the same accuracy task from the same process because of embedded software logic. </br>

🦁💬 Determine from willing attached into the process from unknow sources is determination than known sources because they can perform intellectual property rights apply to your work or they have some logic understanding in plan scenarios. I am talking about using an artificial intelligence program from the University because of the case study I can explain later ... </br>
