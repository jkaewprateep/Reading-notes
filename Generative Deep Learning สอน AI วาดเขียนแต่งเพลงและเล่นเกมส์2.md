[ Coupling layer ]: 🧸💬 Coupling layer is a response function for sampling and update values can be found from transformations such as Fourier transform. This method of data communication encryption/decryption. It can be performed on online signals or in the book called real-time networks. ( Television or radio channels broadcasting standard ) </br>

🐑💬 ➰ TCP/IP transformation headers had frames and update values with a fast update method between frames reference and scopes of their reference as they had. Data at the present time is data with the previous time frame and changes. Examples of image bandwidths are free television, educational radios ( information broadcasting), and balanced data communications ( unbalanced bandwidths ). </br>

🐐💬 Application management remote resources or bandwidth can be occupied before data transmission and repeating of the data communication message. Accelerate data communication and access to resource property and return value secured by priority queue and ability of data management. Some hotfixes removed this behavior, to select OS management of VMware management as telecommunication bandwidths. </br>

🤠💬 Use unbalanced ( balance bandwidths by required channels ) to prevent priority in communication because all communication is the first priority, conversation, and intermediate signals transfer for the channel. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO,  It creates a delay time but only time cycling to gather information and restore the data frames, does not use the same pass-codes and time cycling to prevent readable messages. </br>

🦤💬 Television boxes can do this but they are reserved for business reasons. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Mobile phones and portable consoles use the channel and do not need a strong transmitter in the support area. Why deep real forest gathering had a big rock on hand. </br>

🦁💬 We set up by master race and 4 turtles. </br>
