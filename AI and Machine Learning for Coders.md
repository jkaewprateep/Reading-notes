[ Features matrixes and edges detection for image processing ]: 🧸💬 There are many possible ways to extract features or properties from the input transformed matrix, but for image processing, the kernel application is similar to a determination matrix that identifies image features such as edges detection, region of the object, collision effects, and Gaussian removal. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ In the previous example and application example of Google net when same network performs of the same task concatenated to the current input to identify features from the input image matrix better. This kernel application is widely used because it approximates linear performance growth with good result with target image input continuous. </br>

🐐💬 That is because time domain and velocity are what our brain's recognition works if you cannot remember your exercises from reading a book try shaking it. It will have some orbits here. </br>

🤠💬 There are many types of kernels for artificial neuron networks and they can concatenate inputs or their results when reliability and performance evaluation are performed in larger level or results set and comparison with test data and smaller evaluation is common distribution values from gained weights and response functions. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, possibly go through node performance but go this way knowledge transfer can be performed for evaluation, size deduction, or changed network types because of new capacity or support software and hardware. </br>

🦤💬 That is because of data input can have multiple folds for evaluation compared with the same types of networks cannot perform directly but transferred to dense layers networks help in comparing multiple types of networks because fundamental. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 I have some problems with transforming into dense layer networks later I found commercials model has a sense of data patterns that may come with manufacturing data models. </br>

🦁💬 These feature matrices such as edge detection and image regions are free for application same as some image feature weights such as smile and hand. You can download it for better weight training into some camera filters as well. </br>
