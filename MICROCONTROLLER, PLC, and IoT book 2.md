[👧💬 🎈 Integration logic gates/activation functions ]: There are multiple activation functions you can simulate using development software applications such as TensorFlow, Scikitlearn, TFLearn, Matlab, and Simulink and IBM machine learning APIs ( Scikit learn and scientific development software APIs ). </br>
🐑💬 ➰ In the picture there are three software simulation gates, differentiate, integration area, and ratios. Working results concatenate is an online data extraction method for the simulation of inputs and products and the simulation results for the function prediction of the overall logic gates. </br>
🧸💬 By data extraction method reduces work-load, and improve prediction efficiency, effectively improves learning time and capable for logging and transformation methods. </br>

🐐💬 Same as input current when motors had workload apply, the current requirement raised and goto to steady state where the frequency of the pulse is adjusted to detect and determine the correct function and limitation. ( See in the pictures, pulse of the identity function detected when repeating current signals can transform by differentiate function or requirements inputs and effectiveness can be monitored from integrated functions. </br>
🦭💬 These accelerate working is self-monitoring, concatenate integrated signals and create larger bandwidths with small efforts impedance that is integrated meters we are using⁉️ </br>
🐯💬 It is Culture-INFO the cat meter does not determine how many cats are on board. </br>
