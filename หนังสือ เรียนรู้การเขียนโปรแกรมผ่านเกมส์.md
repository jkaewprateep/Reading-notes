[Model collision domain]: 🧸💬 There are many solution approaches for the game's problem statement to solution and for one problem statement we try to apply the model collision domain, simply explaining as a bigger box passed the smaller boxes is easier to pass the approaching channel. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ The visual box dimension may related to the environment and the object to environment property where some of developers tell it is similar to gates and portal all aligned and the boxes passed by selecting of immediate scenarios and larger learning policy. </br>
🐐💬 Faster velocity movement requires faster response but it is sensitive when the object moves with the acceleration speeds, one more requirement is speed limits and turnover of the object because at each velocity and corner, they are significant. </br>
. </br>
. </br>
👧💬 🎈 It is object communications because they have high rates of relatively updated information during their function. </br>
🦭💬 Yes if there are spikes but continue movement with accelerated velocity any wall can be spikes. </br>
👧💬 🎈 We shield the box with our collision domain protected from rains and storms ( invariance environment variables, in functional is random stages objects, target bullets, and opinions ) </br>
. </br>
🧸💬 In our small collision domain counter our rains and storms, I watch from movie but I am curious why they use the word counter. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ That is because the mission impossible always creates internal communication over external communications. </br>
