[ Polymorphism ]: 🧸💬 When communiation application micro-services or web applications, there is a message state with the property as we are coding development in React.js, C# event listener, and DjanGo application. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ Collision messages are message communication and they result or update their property from the state collision. We determined the action response from the collision message is because a communication network broadcasting message is their property that the system needs to maintain for the operations but when the action response to the message it is message collision. </br>

🐐💬 In the communication investigation fundamental we need the original message and their collision to determine the result, database, configuration, and setting are collision messages because they respond to only specific input commands. The response to any input is not configuration settings but system-wide range property that is not system response because they react to all messages the same for saved configuration is responsible by the platform engineer. </br>

🐯💬 The incident level created from Wide-ranges may not high priority if they can prove it is a broadcasting message when some trusted domain applications are performed based on wide-ranges applications and working in many organizations. They are high-effects with lower priority. Culture-INFO is a response to wide-ranges broadcast systems when less differentiated logical applies to operating systems. </br>

🦁💬 In the organize that required domain controllers, policy, and user permissions control high contrast with larger broadcasting level will consider master as in master - salve logics for application support algorithms. There is a telephony system and telecommunication system that require master - salve hardware and software when application support reads and collects the system working logs, and collision messages they are required to add into cases which side is master and slave or application operation flows that will determine checkpoints in the diagram of the case issue investigation. </br>

🦭💬 In many systems the master is a database when collisions are everywhere ... protect your sources that is life savings. ... </br>
