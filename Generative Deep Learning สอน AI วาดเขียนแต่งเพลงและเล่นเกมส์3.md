[ Stochastic Gradient ]: 🧸💬 In large input data examples with required less time response, selection of input or making significant for use of the input without external data required is Stochastic Gradient. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ Information extraction has multiple methods including extreme significance and contrasting differences as in the example of Langevin Dynamics. Information from contrast differences of logarithm domain inputs indicated significance too. </br>

🐐💬 Define the scope of the study as defined by the convolution matrix for the input evaluation, by focus method or clipping of the input for focus with gradient value changes can reduce of next time calculation. Imagine you are defining objects on the screen with a tabular table the object has speed and property and the next time of the process does not require a restart. </br>

🤠💬 More than simpler in application because of the use of single or multiple threads detection but you can assign property windows, correct scales, and performance efficiency tool matching. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, all visualize are the same with clipping or none clipping method, and likely find neighborhoods with the application. </br>

🦤💬 Neighbourhood linear alignment blocking the windows to apply their property when can apply directory windows. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Not only object detection applications but alignment, gap communications, angular velocity, and suitable application of instrument usage ranges. </br>

🦁💬By overall data contrast convergence is simpler to compare with Contrastive Divergence, CD method because information compares and operates in logarithms domain. </br>
