Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow

[ Basics TensorFlow - matrix operations ]: 🧸💬 Data operation is important as data input where to develop the solution from public source media. </br>

🐑💬 ➰  From the sample you provide easy input data from MIC to matrix value with padding and distribution layer for data input media matching operations. </br>

🐐💬 You can now process speech recognition or data operations from the data input as a matrix in Tensor form or convert to the stored dataset, Numpy, or scientific data formats. </br>

🤠💬 I have skills in mathematics as I can provide DET matrix for data compression and I build compression matrix same as in computer data communication and computer programming .zip or .rar when some science institute accepted both formats. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, worldwide you must use .zip format that is because guarantees bandwidths value or they send unzip matrix algorithms when there is no available at the aother end. </br>

🦤💬 Compression matrix is different than learning because compressing and decompressing create the same values of data information when learning is an improvement in your learning matrix same as artificial learning. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Consider values and distribution the AI learning is more specific in their own research group unless they are creating some method people can use for re-distribution. </br>

🦁💬 You can use his Python script to create your own speech recognition tasks or study or even perform as a data generator connected to famous Specch recognitions engines such as Sphinx or build your own. And of course, you can speak Minions. </br>
