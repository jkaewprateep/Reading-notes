🧸💬🔧 In the micro-controller with a steps motor ( mother can have multiple velocities of speed and direction control by the remote controller ) they had signals { 0, 1, 2 } for forward, backward, and action where 0 can signal clockwise and 1 for counter-clockwise by the controller setup. In the same manner at the manufacturing age their motors also working with good condition but different direction than another company, we need to modify body for some electrical chamber for use them but somebody say they are worth it because of differentiation. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ It is not by the side working selection they are using clockwise and counter clockwise for torque create motors you can work with different loads when different objective also created by different motor workload directions. </br>
🧸💬🔧 That is because you are using high durable motors with common work that create a lot of proficiency and how you can find them is works too. </br>
👧💬 🎈 In high efficient motors they required a lot of input but they return generate power but they are working with the required full ganvanor circuits, they can continue durable work load with power consumption efficientcy. </br>
🐐💬 That is durable circuits because of high power output the circuits maintain their performance, durable ciicuits and later I think they found Duracell battery power as today. </br>
* They have a good teacher too, a small step create a different and I am sure they know how much workload should they select when they buy a new electrical control breaker. </br>

🦭💬 I know balance-unbalance circuits that help us know about workload and putout generate quality, a small steps and larger step of velocity distance with information. </br>
