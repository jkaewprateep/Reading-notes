[ Wasserstein GAN networks ]: 🧸💬 By considering the overall effects of two or more dataset folds categorizing the WGAN networks allows the optimizer to update training weight by its function according to changes in mean or mean values of both datasets in comparison. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ Think about residual solutions for the distribution dataset as we work on both categorization and determination scenarios. By precision, we train our model for accuracy for samples significant and long enough to learn all samples. Still, we can do it one at a time for determination or categorization. By overviews, we update the determination as the residual levels. </br>

🐐💬 Residual levels because the experiment in our determination is to categorize real and fakes, and update of residual levels the truths of solution changes create training weight values updated. Cleaning examples and text vectorization are important because some samples always be true. </br> 

🤠💬 You may consider gradient areas because in our example some areas are high priority and are supposed to be included with the greater effects overall. The model and solution still learning by setup learning method supervised or none-supervised but we can remark for feedback areas such as labels, graphic information, or patterns line mapped. </br>

🧸💬 Some studies say remarkable areas never have less value than normal distribution but how the experimenter pays value for the remarkable and suitable feedback to the machine learning process. Some remarkable cannot be reable as text but are high priority even more with accuracy inputs. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, gradient values enough to perform learning for the experiment process but initially should start with providing learning values from sources and when the weights are updated they cannot re-do. The backup process is important backup and restore method and parameters should define to continue work with your team. ( Save and restore not always have the same wright values since simplify process setup parameters but always provide good result, see example from IBM online course save and restore or setup no simplify will help you pass assignment with exact values assignment required ) </br>

🦤💬 I used to question about the algorithms of Tensorflow, compare with Microsoft model and experiment model and I found the problem is not weights saved in the model and they had encryption method to prevent use of the saved value directly with out correct restore method. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬  We found the experiment results is our objective and hacking or decryption is not provide our expected results when our work lead to read unreadble message communications. How to prevent hackers from inner otherwise many people can sunsess with the same methods they setup. </br>

🦁💬 That must be a great experiment if the objective is not to read encrypted message with password cracking methods but the results of the experiment achieved by we focus to our goals. </br>
