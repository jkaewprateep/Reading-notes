[ Statistics significant and gradient decent ]: 🧸💬 The p-hackings value is good in programming methods by estimating how much of percentage error when you have method definition. Similarly, you can perform simulations within the tabular software application and estimate the yield authority for the investment when understanding the recurrent function of mathematics methods. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ The p-hacking method has a definition and can perform in a range of values when probabilities of error, ROC, and cumulative table values are comparable with data sources. </br>

🐐💬 Gradient values are determined from known gradient loss function to perform direction or significant method to find the solution optima with target loss values optimize function. The mean square error is a wide acceptance method with high growth rates and can be proven with multiple methods we have studied. </br>

🧸💬 In the implementation for server communication level in the distribution system using the Gradient tape optimizer function, perform a clipping method to remove duplicates and scope of the performing input functions. By using the clipping value we can perform a summing deduction because the estimate function will not cause an unstable unbalance of the new cost value on linear. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, the p-hackings value is widely used and performance in programming but as defined they are more likely to function definition testing function. As long as p-hackings are true your function is working in programming. True accuracy does not affect overall results such as call lists or tossing the coin because performance accuracy and performance are different. </br>

🦤💬 Gains need to continue gains for the performance he means high performance, stability, and continuity are values of development. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 In high development performance created from work that is a change of the status potential steady change has more advantage in this evaluation because there is more integration space and contact area see from the integration graph. Simply find the AUC area under the line curve over accuracy performance because working had time and management creates value by managing resources for continuity of the performance. </br>

🦁💬 ROC is not managed when AUC is operation managing, integration area, and the contact area is property. High development without management is only a score. </br>
