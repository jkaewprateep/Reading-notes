[Agent environment]: 🧸💬 Machine learning with an agent environment updates the value to determine single-agent or multiple-agent prediction results for concatenate results or evaluation results to evaluate the final action to perform. Differently, multi-head attention networks are evaluated of continuous input with current and previous state and compare or operation the final output can have one logit shape. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ Yesterday someone watched a car engine maintenance fixing when it cannot start or the engine and no gasoline fuel emitted, in close environment sensor is important since the application needs to action response and consider the pressure system as the velocity speed system, x-axis distance is motor inverter sensor and y-axis value and objects related to obstacle and accelerate speed. Our CPU controls the balance with the highest speed to move forward and escape from obstacles. </br>

🐐💬 Give rewards the accelerator will continue forward and machine learning learns that more steps continue without hitting collision walls or obstacles will provide more rewards, machine learning to our set goal to achieve the highest rewards. </br>

🤠💬 There are many patterns for multiple discriminators to categorize when our solution should not be too complex. A polynomial function created from training games environment inputs with multiple degrees polynomial function to predict action response { HOLD, ACCELERATE } </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, in close system feedback, everyone knows the control function and features function with their priority the polynomial function is transformed functions and needs pattern categorized with input function for the development process. </br>

🦤💬 Recursive functions are sufficient methods of programming, natural observation, and resolution with the performance considering when polynomial is applicable function and understand by study and sensible by parameter categorized. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 It is a P-recursive equation where the presence of a recursive function in a linear polynomial function, transformation reduces degrees of polynomial or significant selective method. </br>

🦁💬 There are multiple equations to perform and how we can create a model solution with a single polynomial function to perform tasks in the same environment. I wish I had some budget to continue studying at University and the way Polynomial functions is already significant function. </br>

🦤💬 Significant functions can be published because it is hard to revert with modification. </br>
