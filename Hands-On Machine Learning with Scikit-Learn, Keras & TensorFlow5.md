[ Dataset and data transformation  ]: 🧸💬 There are multiple methods to prepare and transform data, an example from the book examines how to use .map() function to create a list of mapping values for data transformation as zip() in memory reference and mixed of files or data sources using .interleave() technique. </br>

🐑💬 ➰  By published dataset or custom dataset you may be referred to dataset class inheritance as in the picture and you can perform logic, add values, override a method, add a property or even add authentication and verification method inside the custom dataset class when model.train() call dataset.getitem(), dataset.__str__ or dataset.__validate() they are interchange functions. </br>

🐐💬 Some datasets had embedded logical or work online datasets. They perform login to remote sources for request of data into the next steps of work offline with notification methods. </br>

🤠💬 During the experiment we found a dataset published we work online and in a closed environment virtual VMware, It online its notified of the data source but there is no problem because we are working for education and research. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, Some data required research and work surveys. For online data, you had a verification method and updated value that estimated how important data statistics are for research and development. </br>

🦤💬 As in some applications and development systems they acquire money or project opportunities by importance of their work launched. The correct way is to respond to their surveys and continue with statistics for data gatherers and research scientists. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬  Some data working offline 100% they also had access logging and verification method we built inside the dataset but notification or request for information usage does not happen individually because of selective sources and objective of study and research. They are strictly able to access VPN security for some partner private companies. </br>

🦁💬 The Network layer convolution .convolve1() and .convolve2() are not bugs but environment settings and understanding of students. They work well when loop-calling convoluted functions from the book examples. ( published in IBM exercises too ) </br>
