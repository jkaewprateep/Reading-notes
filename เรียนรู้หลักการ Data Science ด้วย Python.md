[ Function expression ]: 🧸💬 There are multiple use cases of function expression in pre-defined and concurrent or Lambda functions. To perform defined tasks, working with data by newly defined function, perform data aggregation by specific criteria and external functions. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ In some limited or specific domain environments the IT administrator enforcement rules by resource access, local policy, and swap memory permission right accessibility to filtered of user commands in this case is Lambda function because there is no external function and swap memory size limited. </br>

🐐💬 They are transferable and use a little time to practice but they perform with memory streams inline that users may not use this advantage except to print out memory data accesses. </br>

🦭💬 In data preparation when you need to perform different external commands on the same dataset such as Numpy, Scikit, Scipy, Statistics, etc on the same Panda dataset without using a data science programming platform such as Tensorflow you may need to use the Lambda function for data preparation tasks for the same line of codes present. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO Within memory streams means if the codes work when computation is limited and space is limited, the answer will perform on the same stream running the main task without interruption by application method invokable. </br>

🦤💬 Space limits we need to run, we can not transform directional and application Asynchronous tasks because they are console programs, and the command and objective have priority when our command is the same priority as any command. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 The Same antique Python program Lambda prevents the access limits, the Directive program conforms before submitting the instruction, reliability is when an application can un-do and re-do the task when working with multiple applications in roles, and commitment is scheduled that work with all applications in the same console environments. 
* In example is use of different GroupBy and external function for aggregation methods
