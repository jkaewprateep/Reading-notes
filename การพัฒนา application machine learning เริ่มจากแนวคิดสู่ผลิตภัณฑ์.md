[ Word appearance and neighborhoods ]: 🧸💬 Continue from the correlation if we had some set of patterns and we need to find one or more closet or contrast matching patterns there are multiple ways to improve of text sentence and string pattern matching in the machine learning methods. </br>

🐑💬 ➰  This explain TFID, Longest matching, and string pattern for word sentence commands, rules for input/output, grammar, policy, and documents such as speech recognition, DNA pattern, long series, or documents such as ChatGPT we see from many media. </br>

🐐💬 Pattern matching or contrast matching is a task capacity for machine learning for a long time. Still, enchantment with an algorithm such as TfidfVectorizer and logistics categorizes create of a new sequence from a new input sequence is not difficult. </br>

🧸💬 There are work many professors and students who need to work on the document proof process before submitting their work or they are done automatically this reference provides a good example of a document paraphrase with coding. Next time do not try to create more linked word sentences than it should that is sorted order word list as in document paradigms too. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, possible you can have sentences or references the same as the sources you are learning and we know from reading from your document but you need to reference them in the correct way. </br>

🦤💬 There are many documents related to IT security and lists or datasets that can be downloaded or sources provided by the proof organization or limited access private company with different update times and data retention. The method is proven and the results from the experiments and we had a method to verify by time request to provide for multiple folds. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Is there anything to provide than a DNS list when they do not use the real-DNS server⁉️ They cannot directly access external sources without a medium even VPN or encryption algorithms but they can re-routes by mistakes or configuration. The DNS is not always a source of directory information of the server but accessibilities and areas. </br>

🦁💬 I would say for communication hacks as in the movies most of the time they need to access the POTs or public Internet providers or hubs in the area because they cannot create mediums or they need to reroute with unbalanced mediums that will have time tracking but if you are in the DNS it becomes more and more shorterr. </br>
