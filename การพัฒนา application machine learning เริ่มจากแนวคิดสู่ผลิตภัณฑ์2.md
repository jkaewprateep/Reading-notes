[ Model performance and text word tokenizer ]: 🧸💬 It is simply to say that performance integration matrix evaluation is the evaluation method but when model performance improvement stops word, conjunction, adjective, and sub-conjunction reveal the model's true performance. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ I had read the integration matrix twice because I recognized them as the conjugate matrix, sub conjugate, and adjacent for angular velocity matrix transformation. </br>

🐐💬 You are correct and the meaning of documents depends on their context the most, you had a working trained model but you can have about this context model performance problem that creates different output expected with high accuracy scores. </br>

🤠💬 Some information bends in the mediums including frequency because high frequency has more chance for interaction particles. </br>

🧸💬 Many libraries provide text tokenizers, matrix operation, and features management but in Tensorflow they provide custom methods with class inheritance properties, defined methods, and functions in Python and C library. Multiple words are significant as stop words or sometimes they are conjugate or contense conversation makers and that is language model study. </br>

🐯💬 Culture-INFO, update language model or codes please provide sources, objectives, and references. Please perform as coding remarks in language document library download they provide syntax and update patterns as when you download or from websites and weblogs. </br>

🦤💬 A few steps follow to create performance model development and evaluation but the practical method depends on the evaluation results and applications. Once you have a target performance do not stop but compare with the same model in the evaluation and different methods or your colleagues. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Keep backup, always continue forward cannot make it the success goals easy. In the working environment still have interaction system can help you with pre-defined inputs and recognition processes to improve the model performance. </br>

🦁💬 We are a work-study group please be strict on your model results we had a working model with no high-accuracy but we can see the example. Not only evaluation matrix how you can prove the model performance to have the approval for the production system also had some construction process. This story is because some customers respond in the same conversation and have high learning values in the system. I would find a person to explain this scenario but he may try to craft the model from home. 🔍🤔 </br>
