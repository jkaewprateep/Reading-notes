[User state/Message state diagram]: 👧💬 🎈In software data communication to perform multiple tasks, multiple services with validation and status of the services they are using User state/Message state diagram to determine possibility action with update data communication among services in the operation application flow. </br>

🐐💬 User credential email are different service than the email system because they need two times for more configuration to create confirmation messages such as email broadcasting and authentication email messages. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ In a symmetry way the email server only requires user information and user details registered in the user domain or user account credential services, they cannot change information or verify with the integrated system from only email confirmation or email distribution they require mapping of information both systems or more. This is action action-activated system that requires action to perform levitate permission or activation rules apply. </br>

🐐💬 The activation rules for manual or automatic processes with logging to determine action owner and system responsibilities, you can not request to delete (deactivate) or change information contact for financial users when they register services, they can do but you need to submit new contact address and verified this is simple rules and some rules are performed automatically. </br>

🧸💬 We aim to create body and information body messages for information in primary and delays services such as fees, registration or queue messages, and additional costs from delays services systems. Performing this method allowed you to work with mobile applications and portable services without delays because they had standard calculations or some delays in updating fields. The customer does not like delays in updating fields we designed for the application display, costs ( some are prediction costs ), and cycling method for accuracy fast update method that may require hour or day in previous. </br>

🐯💬 Culture INFO mobile application will process messages as their priority some messages with delay service information will perform update message and update one new value updated, this is state message that effects multiple views in the mobile applications. </br>

🦁💬 As long as it is correct and backtracking verifiable because devices is users expecting and become primary when you provide services as an application. </br>
